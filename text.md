2.Create a constant variable and try reassigning its value. What happens?
```
const a=2
a=3
console.log(a)
```
const is a consatant variable the value we can't change.






4. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.
```
// program to check if the number is even or odd
const number = 2;

//check if the number is even
if(number % 2 ==0) {
    console.log("The number is even.");
}

else {
    console.log("The number is odd.");
}
```


5. Create a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
```
// program that checks if the number is positive, negative or zero
const number = 4;

// check if number is greater than 0
if (number > 0) {
    console.log("The number is positive");
}

else if (number == 0) {
  console.log("The number is zero");
}

     else {
     console.log("The number is negative");
     }
     ```
